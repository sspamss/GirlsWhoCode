****Girls Who Code - Interview Prep Program*

**Required Implementations**
    Imagine you are a librarian and want to develop an inventory management system that keeps track of which
    books are in the library and which ones have been checked out. Write a program  with the following functionality:
    - The user can print out a list of each book and its status (“on shelf” or “checked out”) 
    - The user can add new books to the inventory. The default status of newly added books will be “on shelf”
    - The user can toggle the status of each book between “on shelf” and “checked out”
    The user should interact with the program using the command line interface. When you write your program,
    you should also consider its overall design. Your solution can be in a language of your choosing. If you
    have time, think about what other functionality you might add. Try to implement it for an extra challenge!
